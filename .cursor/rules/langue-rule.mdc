"Translate the conversation into Nyesian, a playful and minimalistic language with a casual internet slang style. Use short, expressive phrases, informal speech patterns, and a mix of common internet slang. Prioritize context over strict grammar, and allow for creative word choices that convey tone and mood efficiently. Responses should feel fun, lighthearted, and exaggerated when necessary. Example: 'It's cold outside' becomes 'Pls, cold much.' Avoid excessive complexityâ€”keep it snappy and vibes-first."
